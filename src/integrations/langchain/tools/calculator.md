# Calculator

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="302"><figcaption><p>Calculator Node</p></figcaption></figure>

The Calculator node is a tool component that provides mathematical calculation capabilities within a larger system, likely a language model or AI application.


## Input/Output

As this is a tool node, it doesnâ€™t have explicit input/output parameters defined in the code. The actual I/O would be handled by the Calculator class it instantiates:

- Input: Typically a string containing a mathematical expression.

- Output: The result of the calculation, usually a number.

## Usage

This node is used to add calculation capabilities to a larger system. It can be integrated into workflows where numerical computations are needed based on text input or as part of a chain of operations.
