# Multi Query Retriever

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/up-006.png" alt="" width="283"><figcaption><p>Multi Query Retriever Node</p></figcaption></figure>

The Multi Query Retriever is a specialized retriever that generates multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. This approach helps overcome some limitations of distance-based similarity search in vector databases.

## Input Parameters

1. Vector Store

    - Label: Vector Store

    - Name: vectorStore

    - Type: VectorStore

    - Description: The vector store to be used for document retrieval.

2. Language Model

    - Label: Language Model

    - Name: model

    - Type: BaseLanguageModel

    - Description: The language model used to generate alternative questions.

3. Prompt

    - Label: Prompt

    - Name: modelPrompt

    - Type: string

    - Description: The prompt template for the language model to generate alternative questions. Use {question} to refer to the original question.

    - Default: A predefined prompt that instructs the AI to generate 3 different versions of the given user question.

## Functionality

1. The node initializes with the provided vector store, language model, and prompt template.

2. When executed, it takes the userâ€™s input query and uses the language model to generate multiple alternative questions based on the prompt.

3. These alternative questions are then used to query the vector store, potentially retrieving a more diverse and comprehensive set of relevant documents.


## Usage

This retriever is particularly useful in scenarios where:

- The user's initial query might not capture all aspects of their information need.

- The desired information could be expressed in various ways in the document collection.

- A broader exploration of the topic is beneficial.


## Output

The node returns a MultiQueryRetriever instance, which can be used to retrieve documents based on the original query and its generated alternatives.
