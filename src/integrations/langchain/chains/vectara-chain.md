## How It Works
1. The chain receives a user question.
2. If input moderation is enabled, it checks the input for potential harmful content.
3. The Vectara store retrieves relevant documents based on the question.
4. The retrieved documents are processed and ranked.
5. The specified summarizer prompt is used to generate a concise answer from the top-ranked documents.
6. The answer is formatted with reordered citations.
7. The final answer and source documents are returned as output.
