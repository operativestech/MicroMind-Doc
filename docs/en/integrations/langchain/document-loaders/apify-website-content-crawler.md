# Apify Website Content Crawler

[Apify](https://apify.com/) is a web scraping and data extraction platform that provides an app store with more than a thousand ready-made cloud tools called Actors.

The [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor can deeply crawl websites, clean their HTML by removing a cookies modals, footers, or navigation, and then transform the HTML into Markdown. This Markdown can then be stored in a vector database for semantic search or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
